## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of three deep learning lab exercises. Each lab focuses on different aspects of deep learning techniques and their applications.

## Lab 1: CNN and ResNet
### Exercise 1.1: Residual Networks
Quantify why the residual versions of the networks learn more effectively.

### Exercise 1.2: Fully-Convolutional Networks
Take one of your trained classifiers (CNN or ResNet) and fully-convolutionalize it. Turn it into a network that can predict classification outputs at all pixels in an input image. Attempt to turn this into a detector of handwritten digits.

### Exercise 1.3: CNN Attention
Use your implementation to demonstrate how your trained CNN attends to specific image features to recognize specific classes.

## Lab 2: Deep Reinforcement Learning
### Exercise 2.1: Solving Lunar Lander with REINFORCE
Implement a policy gradient method (REINFORCE) to solve the Lunar Lander environment.

### Exercise 2.2: Solving Cartpole and Lunar Lander with Deep Q-Learning
Implement Deep Q-Learning to solve the Cartpole and Lunar Lander environments.

### Exercise 2.3: Solving the OpenAI CarRacing Environment
Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm to solve the OpenAI CarRacing environment.

## Lab 3: Adversarial Learning and OOD Detection
### Exercise 3.1: Implementing ODIN for OOD Detection
Implement the ODIN method for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection.

### Exercise 3.2: Implementing JARN
Implement the JARN technique for adversarial robustness.

### Exercise 3.3: Targeted Adversarial Attacks
Experiment with targeted adversarial attacks and evaluate their impact on model performance.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python 3.7 or higher installed.

## Results
The results of each exercise, including performance metrics, plots, and model evaluations, are documented in the respective Jupyter notebooks and reports within each lab exercise directory.
