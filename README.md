# Deep-Learning-Applications


## Lab 1 CNN and ResNet
### Exercise 2.1 : Quantify why the residual versions of the networks learn more effectively.
### Exercise 2.2 : Take one of your trained classifiers (CNN or ResNet) and fully-convolutionalize it. That is, turn it into a network that can predict classification outputs at all pixels in an input image. Can you turn this into a detector of handwritten digits? Give it a try.
### Exercise 2.3 : Use your implementation to demonstrate how your trained CNN attends to specific image features to recognize specific classes.

## Lab 3 Deep Reinforcement Learning Laboratory
### Exercise 3.1 : Solving Lunar Lander with REINFORCE 
### Exercise 3.2 : Solving Cartpole and Lunar Lander with Deep Q-Learning
### Exercise 3.3 : Solving the OpenAI CarRacing environment

## Lab 4 Adversarial Learning and OOD Detection
### Exercise 3.1 : Implement ODIN for OOD detection
### Exercise 3.2 : Implement JARN
### Exercise 3.3 : Experiment with targeted adversarial attacks
